# MyReads Project

Udacity My-Reads Project: The project was bootstrapped by create-react-app

## App Functionality

In this application, the main page displays a list of "shelves" (i.e. categories), each of which contains a number of books. The three shelves are:

- Currently Reading
- Want to Read
- Read

Each book has a control that lets you select the shelf for that book. When you select a different shelf, the book moves there. The default value for the control is the current shelf the book is in.

The main page also has a button that shows the search page, which allows you to find books to add to your library.

The search page has a text input that is used to find books. As the value of the text input changes, the books that match that query are displayed on the page, along with a control that lets you add the book to your library.
